# Edge-IoT CTC

This is a source code repository for our IoT lab.

It contains sample code for different sensors provided in the IoT lab. 

Groups are welcome to use this place to upload their project code.

## Basics
There are several kinds of microcontroller boards or micro computers in our lab. The two most popular ones are:

### Arduino Uno WiFi Rev2
This is a microcontroller board. It is able to read inputs and turn them into outputs. It must be programmed with the **Arduino IDE** in **C/C++** languages.

See details in https://docs.aruduino.cc/hardware/uno-wif-rev2

### Raspberry Pi 4B
This is a credit-sized programmable computer, which means it can do a lot more than just input/output. 

There are two Raspberry Pi tutorial books in our lab. Feel free to read them as you need.

## Code samples
Sample code for using some of the sensors will be uploaded. Python files will run on Raspberry Pi.

***If you need any help, feel free to ask Tomas or Ryan.***
